# Scripting with OpenPYXL by Connor Lariviere, 7/01/2024
## Input
The script takes the 1983_Mobile_Devices.xlsx file or any similarly formatted file as input by changing a parameter in the script that targets a file.
## Output 
An extra sheet will be added to the original file that contains an array of buildings, how many devices each building has, and the apps on those devices. 

## Info
This script uses Python along with the Openpyxl library to edit Microsoft Excel files. In order to save changes, the file must be closed when starting the program.
The 1983_Mobile_Devices.xlsx file is the original file with no modifications, and the 1983Devices.xlsx is the modified file that contains the output of the script
